Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.

Towards the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance, there was born a fair woman who sang in such wonderous tones that even the Elves would stop and listen in silence for so long as she would sing for them. Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains. This book is of Elvish origin, having been written so long ago that few of the Elves today were alive at the time of its writing. You cannot even guess at how old it actually is, as it seems to show few signs of age or decay. You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break. It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safe-guard its secrets in an age long past.
