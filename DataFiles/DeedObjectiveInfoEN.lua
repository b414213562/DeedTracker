Unfortunately, the argument remains quite abstract within these pages, as the scholars of Men who penned the work seem only to know of these events through legends and myths, and the Elves of that time were apparently not keen to discuss the subject openly.

In particular, the scholar points out the story of a simple and friendly Oath offered at the birthday of a minor noble of the houses of Númenor -- an Oath that in the course of time and events drew his house into a years-long war which served to destroy the fortunes of his family and saw him die a lonely pauper.
