Version 1.3.1 is now available at [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1139-DeedTracker.html]lotrointerface.com[/url].

This release includes a bunch of accumulated fixes for things like Landscape Difficulty (U30), Brawler (U30.3), and Fate of Gundabad (U31) deeds. It also includes a nice-to-have where you can load the Deed Tracker in session play in a 'read-only' mode. Great for browsing your todo list during Chicken Session Play!

(I tried to include an overhaul of the UI so it draws much faster when switching deed tabs, but it introduced enough bugs that it will have to wait for a future release.)
