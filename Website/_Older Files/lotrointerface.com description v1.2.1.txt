[SIZE="4"][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]Introduction[/COLOR][/SIZE]

Deed Tracker is designed to help you keep track of your completed deeds. (Or, if you're like me, which deeds you haven't done yet.)

Unlike the in-game Deed Log, Deed Tracker will show you every deed for every tab on every page, whether you've started it or not. No more wondering if an area has hidden deeds! Deeds are presented in a hierarchical tree, and a built-in search bar makes finding a specific deed very fast.

Each time you complete something, Deed Tracker checks to see if it was a deed. If it was, it checks it off for you!

Deed Tracker provides a quick way to see where you can find more LOTRO Points and Virtue XP, and gives progress at the tab, page, and overall level.

Ever complete multiple deeds at once and get frustrated that the game only remembers the last deed you completed? The Completion Window tracks them as long as you want, provides a button to send your completion to a chat channel of your choice, and you can produce a short summary.

Want a way to see which deeds your other characters have completed? Deed Tracker lets you see Deed Tracker status for each of your characters on that server with a handy character selection dropdown.

Due to limitations in the LOTRO scripting interface, Deed Tracker cannot tell which deeds you have already completed. Don't let that stop you, though! By default, when you complete a deed (for example, Slayer of Bree-land), Deed Tracker will automatically mark all prerequisite deeds complete. This works when you manually check deeds off, too!

Notes:
[list]
[*]See a description of all the features at http://deedtracker.lifebeyondtheshire.com/
[*]Unlike the in-game Deed Log, Deed Tracker cannot tell how far along you are on a deed. Deed Tracker is meant to be a companion to the in-game Deed Log, to serve as an easy way to guide your deeding.
[*]There are numerous, identically-named deeds in LOTRO (for instance: warg-slayer). When you complete one of these, Deed Tracker will try to determine which one it was. If it cannot, it will display a window asking you to select the correct one.
[*]Currently only English is supported.

[list]
[*]Needs support for French & German
[*]When "Hide completed deeds" is on, when there are two categories in a row, the first category is treated as empty is hidden incorrectly.
[*]Deed Tracker does not currently know which landscape region each instance "belongs" to, so if you complete a landscape deed while in an instance, the disambiguation window can't highlight the most likely one.
[*]In "Hide completed deeds", when a tab doesn't have any eligible deeds (see Allegiances for a character < 110), the progress bar is blue.
[*]The Anniversary Scavenger Hunt auto bestows and completes before plugins are loaded, and must be checked off manually.
