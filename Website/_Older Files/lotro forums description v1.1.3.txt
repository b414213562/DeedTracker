Version 1.1.3 is now available at [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1139-DeedTracker.html]lotrointerface.com[/url].

I'm very excited about two new features this release:

One-click sharing of deed completion with the channel of your choice - great for letting your group know you're done with that slayer deed. :D
Click the chat bubble to share, and change the channel at the bottom. (Thanks to [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1053-FowlMap.html]FowlMap[/url] for the inspiration!)

If you use Waypoint, there's now one-click target setting for location-based deed objectives:
