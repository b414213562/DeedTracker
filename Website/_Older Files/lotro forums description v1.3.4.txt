Version 1.3.4 release notes:

Deeds:
[list]
[*] Added Instances / The Mountain-hold / The Hiddenhoard of Abnank√¢ra deeds
[*] Added Class/Race/Epic / Reputation / Kindred to the Defenders of the Angle deed
[*] Added Eriador / Trollshaws / The Angle of Mitheithel deeds
[*] Added Legendary Server deeds for Grey Mountains, Level 120
[/list]

Bugs:
[list]
[*] A few Class / Race / Vocation deeds were not displayed correctly after 1.3.3 changed how those deeds were stored internally. These are now fixed.
[*] A check against current Class / Race / Vocation was not updated correctly after 1.3.3. This is now fixed. (Thanks to Crell for finding this!)
[*] The names of Guardian and Hunter difficulty deeds got swapped in 1.3.3.
[*] Deed Tracker will no longer consider deeds with minimum levels above the character's current level. (e.g. Instances / Shadows of Angmar / Woe of the Willow -- Tier 1 has a minimum level of 125, but the quest Woe of the Willow -- Tier 1 can be completed when running the instance at level 20. Instead of prompting the player each time, Deed Tracker will ignore the deed until the player gets to level 125.)
[*] Deeds marked completed that with a minimum level above the character's current level now show their checkbox, so they can be uncompleted if needed.
[*] Chat monitoring turned off in Session Play.
[*] Disambiguate Dialog no longer stays open if parent of deed also completes. (e.g. the dialog for 'Warg-slayer (Advanced)' will automatically close if 'Slayer of the North Downs' completes.)
[/list]

UI:
[list]
[*] Completion Window now hides/unhides when Toggle HUD is pressed.
[*] Completion Window now closes when Escape is pressed.
[*] Completed Class and Race deeds are now shown, even if character is a different class or race. (Useful in case of race change, or a deed marked complete in error.)
[*] Updated text in Disambiguation Window if quest is possible (e.g. Warg-slayer).
[*] Added button next to character dropdown to reset to current character.
[/list]

Other:
[list]
[*] Split out Info from Debug messages, should only affect users with Verbose Logging on. Informational messages now written in green instead of red.
[/list]
