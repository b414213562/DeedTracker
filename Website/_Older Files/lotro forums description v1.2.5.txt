Version 1.2.5 is now available at [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1139-DeedTracker.html]lotrointerface.com[/url].

I'm very excited to announce initial support for importing deed completion status using the LOTRO Companion desktop application! Do you have thousands of completed deeds, dozens of characters, or both, and the prospect of checking off all of those deeds in-game is too daunting to even begin? Follow the step-by-step instructions in the [url=https://deedtracker.lifebeyondtheshire.com/home/import-deed-completion-from-lotro-companion/]help documentation[/url] for a much more automated process!

Import your character into LOTRO Companion:

Run the import script:

And the Deed Tracker plugin can automatically check off all of your already-completed deeds, and identify deeds that may be incorrectly marked off in the Deed Tracker:

Thanks to Crell on the Deed Tracker Discord server for finding many edge cases in the import script!
