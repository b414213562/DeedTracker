Version 3.0.1 is now available at [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1139-DeedTracker.html]lotrointerface.com[/url].

There are a lot of changes in this release! The biggest is under the covers: the file format has changed for v2.0 to v3.0, and your per-character save files will be updated when you first load the Deed Tracker plugin on each server. If something goes wrong with the update, please contact me at LotroDeedTracker@gmail.com!

Additionally, this update includes the U35 Return to Carn Dûm deeds.
